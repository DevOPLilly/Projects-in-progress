DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GRADLE AND MAVEN

Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects while maven is based on developing pure java language-based software.

Gradle uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language (DSL) for creating project structure, whilw mane uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for creating project structuere.

Gradle focuses on developing application by adding new features to them while maven focuses on developing applications in a given time limit.

 Gradle perfoms better than maven as it is optimized for tracking only current running task, whereas maven does not create local temporary files during software creation and hence-slower.

Gradle avoids Java compilation, maven is necessary to compile.

Gradle is a new tool, which requiers users to spend more time to get used to it. Maven is a known tool, its been there and easily available to users

Gradle supports software development in Java, C, C++, and Groovy. Maven supports software development in Java, Scala, C#, and Ruby.

Gradle is focused on graph of task dependences that do the work, maven is based on phases of the fixed and linear model.

The main goal of gradle is to add functionality in the project whikle the main goal of maven is to finish the project in the given timeline.
